# solar-monitoring-system
 This project uses a solar panel to convert sunlight into electricity, stored in batteries. An Arduino UNO with rain and current sensors processes data, and a Bluetooth module enables real-time monitoring via a mobile app. It offers remote control, efficiency tracking, and preventive maintenance, optimizing energy use and reducing costs.
